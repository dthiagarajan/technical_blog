# Welcome!

Welcome to my blog! Here I will post about some of the things I'm working on that I feel are worth sharing to a wider audience, from beginner to advanced topics broadly within ML.

My main page can be found [here](dthiagarajan.github.io). If you want to reach out to me, you can email me [here](mailto:dthiagar@gmail.com).

Welcome! My name is Dilip Thiagarajan - I'm an incoming AI Engineer at [Paige](https://paige.ai), and was formerly a software engineer and intern at FB, on their Business Integrity ML, Computer Vision, and Ads Content Understanding teams (from most recent to least recent).

I hold a Masters of Engineering in CS, with a specialization in computer vision and machine learning, from Cornell University. I'm interested broadly in the application of computer vision in medical applications, as well as Bayesian machine learning, and statistical learning.

I'm also interested in more unconvential applications of machine learning, such as in sports - I'm fascinated with the derivation and usage of characteristic statistics in analyzing performance of NBA players. Ask me about ideas I have and things I'm working on for projects with respect to data from the NBA!
